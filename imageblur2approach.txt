- Locate the pixels with a value of "1" (e.g. array[x][y]).
- Check whether there are rows above, beneath or to the sides of said pixel.
- Check whether the pixels adjacent to said pixel in these rows have a value of 1.
- If yes, leave unchanged; if not, change the value of adjacent pixels to 1.

Said pixel location: array[x][y]
Pixel above: array[x-1][y]
Pixel below: array[x+1][y]
Pixel on Left: array[x][y-1]
Pixel on Right: array[x][y+1]
